Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

 Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
Example 2:

Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1

        Create an array to hold the paper ciations
        add papers into buckets based on ciations.
        Like buket 1 will have papers with atleast 1 citation and so on

        After counting the citations, we iterate from n down to 0 and calculate the cumulative total of papers with at least i citations. When the cumulative total becomes greater than or equal to i, we've found the h-index, and we return i.

        for(int i:citations){
            if(i>=n)
            count[n]++;
            else
            count[i]++;
        }
        int total = 0;
        for(int i=n;i>=0;i--){
            total+=count[i];
            if(total>=i)
            return i;
        }
        return 0;
